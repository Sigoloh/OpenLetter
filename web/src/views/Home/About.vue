  <h2>What is Open Letter?</h2>
  <h5>Open Letter is my first project made for the Open Source community. Its objective is to democratize the creation of email lists, sending news and analytics for all those interested in being closer of its public.</h5>
  <br/>
  <h2>What is it doing already?</h2>
  <h5>At this point,  Open Letter can do very basic stuff, its functionalities includes: content production account management, creation of email list and mass email distribution.</h5>
  <br/>
  <h2>What is will be capable of do?</h2>
  <h5>The main point of Open Letter, as said before, is to democratize the contact between content productor and its public. This said, I want to make some analytics tools for the project using Open Letter's own link shortening mechanism.</h5>
  <br/>
  <h5>In the future, I want to make a "proprietary" email writer tool, using the core of Markdown implementig some advanced stuff like better image processing, automatic link shortening, etc.</h5>
  <br/>
